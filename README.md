## Deploy

Open Terminal and install git if you haven't done it yet:
```
brew install git
```

Then pull this repository to you working place:
```
git clone https://github.com/eurekazheng/R04-Assignments.git
```

This will create a new folder called "R04-Assignments" under your current working directory.

## Commit

Do your work in this folder (it won't be available for other team members before git push).

Then push you changes to the remote server:
```
git add -A
git commit -m "commit message"
git push
```

Commit message is a short explanation for other team members about your current changes. It's optional (you can just use "git commit") but strongly recommended.

Enter your Github E-mail and password for Username and Password for the first time.

## Update

To update the local repository from the remote, simply enter:
```
git pull
```

**Make sure that all git commands are entered under your local repository directory.**
