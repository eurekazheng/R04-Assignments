## How to commit?

Open Terminal and install git if you haven't done it yet:

```
brew install git
```

Then pull this repository to you working place:

```
git clone https://github.com/eurekazheng/R04-Assignments.git
```

This will create a folder under your current working directory. Commit in this folder (it won't be available for other team members before git push).

Push you changes to the remote server (don't forget the "git add" if you have created new files):
```
cd R04-Assignments
git add newfile1.m newfile2.m
git commit
git push
```

Done.
