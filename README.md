## How to commit?

Open Terminal and install git if you haven't done it yet:
```
brew install git
```

Then pull this repository to you working place:
```
git clone https://github.com/eurekazheng/R04-Assignments.git
```

This will create a folder under your current working directory. Commit in this folder (it won't be available for other team members before git push).

Push you changes to the remote server:
```
cd R04-Assignments
git add -A
git commit -m "commit message"
git push
```

Commit message is a short explanation for other team members about your current changes. It's optional (you can just use "git commit") but strongly recommended.
Enter your Github E-mail and password for Username and Password.
Done.
